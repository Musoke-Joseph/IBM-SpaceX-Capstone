# IBM-SpaceX-Capstone
This report aims to predict the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings. SpaceX has reduced launch costs to $62 million by reusing the first stage of its rockets, compared to $165 million from other providers.
Predicting landing outcomes helps estimate launch costs and supports competitive bids against SpaceX. Using machine learning, this analysis models the probability of successful landings based on historical data and key features like launch conditions, payload mass, and mission type.
Results show that these factors significantly impact landing success, with the best model achieving high accuracy and predictive power. This aids stakeholders in forecasting outcomes and making informed decisions, enhancing market intelligence and assessing potential savings.
